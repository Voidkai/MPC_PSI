# MPC

MPC refers to **Multi-Party Computation**,

There are two methods for secure and verifiable computations ,and the MPC is one important approach, and another one is Outsourced Computation.

 which is one kind of Secure and verifiable computation , and another approach is Outsourced computation.

In MPC, All of protocol participants are data owners.

There are two types of MPC:

1. Generic MPC, for computing any discrete functions can be represented as a fixed-size circuit.
2. **Specialized MPC, For specific functionalities. More efficient than the best generic protocols.**

Applications:

1. Auction,   Voting and Machine Learning.
2. **Stable matching** and spam filtering.
3. **contact discovery(PSI)**
   1. [Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Common Friend-Finder Protocols and Applications](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/620.pdf)

MPC's Protocols:

1. Yao's GC
2. Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson(GMW) Protocol
3. BGM protocol: Based on Shamir secret sharing
4. Constant-Round Multi-Party Computation: BMR
